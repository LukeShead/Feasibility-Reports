# Feasibility-Reports

### What are feasibility reports

Feasibility reports is a report that critically evaluates the individual components of a project, this includes scope, cost, risks and much more all involved with what makes the project feasible or not. It is all done to see how succesful a project can be once it's completed, for example how the project will be seen by the target audience and whether it will be succesful in what it is trying to achieve, the feasibility report will look at the different aspects of the project being succesful.


### Why are feasibility reports important?

Feasibility reports allow companies to gauge projects before they are started, therefore not having to commit anything on that project until they know it can be succesful, for example starting a project and putting in recourses only for it to be useless or fail would mean that the project owners would lose a lot of time and resources that could be invested elsewhere. This is why having a feasibility report is important when looking at starting projects.

## Sections of a feasibility report

Feasibility reports are split up into four sections that each look at different points when analysing the success of the project.
