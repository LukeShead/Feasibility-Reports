# Feasibility-Reports

### What are feasibility reports

Feasibility reports is a report that critically evaluates the individual components of a project, this includes scope, cost, risks and much more all involved with what makes the project feasible or not. It is all done to see how succesful a project can be once it's completed, for example how the project will be seen by the target audience and whether it will be succesful in what it is trying to achieve, the feasibility report will look at the different aspects of the project being succesful.


### Why are feasibility reports important?

Feasibility reports allow companies to gauge projects before they are started, therefore not having to commit anything on that project until they know it can be succesful, for example starting a project and putting in recourses only for it to be useless or fail would mean that the project owners would lose a lot of time and resources that could be invested elsewhere. This is why having a feasibility report is important when looking at starting projects.

## Sections of a feasibility report

Feasibility reports are split up into four sections that each look at different points when analysing the success of the project. 

### 1st: Proposed Project Description

This is the part of the report that focuses on the planning side of the project, the market and sales is not analyzed in this section, this is all about schedule, scope and necessary resources needed for the project. The section does not look at the market value or or brand name or anything that is affected after the completion of the project. Instead it is the design process alone and the costs, time and managment of the project can go well.

### 2nd: Market Analysis Section

This is the complete opposite of the first section, in constrast to the first section, the second focuses completely on the market value of the item, this includes the brand name, sales design and target audience as some examples. This is all about making a profit on the project after it has been built. This section is more important when trying to pitch projects to companies as the company will be more interested in the sales and profit rather than only the use of the project.

### 3rd: Technical Feasibility Section

This is the section that focuses on the special resources that might need to be acquired in order for the project to be successful, this can range from specialized licenses to having a technically trained staff to make the project successful. These special resources usually will cost the most or take up the most time, because of this it means that the project owners will need to make sure that the project is successful.


### 4th: Financial Feasibility Section

This is the final section and it is where the report will talk about the implementation of the product and the cosrs in doing so, for example if the project is server based, the cost of setting up and maintaining the servers will become a point that will need to be looked into.
